JS-DOM-Bookoroma

A simple JavaScript DOM manipulation project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic and interactive web functionality.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents a web page as a tree of objects and allows you to access and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.

🧠 What You’ll Learn

This project helps you understand and practice:

Selecting and updating DOM elements

Handling user events (e.g., button clicks, input changes)

Dynamically adding/removing elements

Changing styles and content with JavaScript

Basic web layout with HTML & CSS

(Because this repo uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, users can see how HTML elements become interactive after page load via JavaScript.)

📖 Learn More About DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of HTML elements in a page that JavaScript can interact with. When the browser loads a page, it constructs the DOM, and JavaScript can use APIs like querySelector, getElementById, addEventListener, and others to manipulate elements dynamically.
